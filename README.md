# Inverted Index: Fast keyword matching, excellent for basic keyword searches. Show an example of an inverted index structure.​

# Embedding-based index (e.g., using word2vec, BERT): Captures semantic relationships between products and queries, enabling better understanding of user intent. Show a simple visualization of word embeddings.​

# Applications
Search Engines: Semantic search capabilities (e.g., Google, Bing).
Recommendation Systems: Suggesting similar items based on user queries.
E-commerce: Enhancing product search with semantic understanding.
Knowledge Bases: Improving retrieval in research databases or customer support systems.​
